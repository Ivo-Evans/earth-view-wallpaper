This is a fork of [neffo/earth-view-wallpaper](https://github.com/neffo/earth-view-wallpaper-gnome-extension), which is designed for GNOME. This is a pared down alternative that uses `wget` to fetch a random image from the curated list and write it to `~/wallpaper.jpg`. My intended use is with Feh to set a wallpaper background.
